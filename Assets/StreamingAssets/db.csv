Ivan Aivazovsky,Ninth wave,1850,Aivazovsky_Ninth_Wave,"The Ninth Wave (Russian: Девятый вал, Dyevyatiy val) is an 1850 painting by Ukrainian-Armenian marine painter Ivan Aivazovsky. It is his best-known work.
The title refers to an old sailing expression referring to a wave of incredible size that comes after a succession of incrementally larger waves.
It depicts a sea after a night storm and people facing death attempting to save themselves by clinging to debris from a wrecked ship. The debris, in the shape of the cross, appears to be a Christian metaphor for salvation from the earthly sin. The painting has warm tones, which reduce the sea's apparent menacing overtones and a chance for the people to survive seems plausible. This painting shows both the destructiveness and beauty of nature."

Maria Prymachenko,Bird of prey,1936,Bird_of_prey,"From the start Maria Prymachenko showed herself to be an artist with a unique world view. In the creation of artistic images in her drawings from the 1930s a decisive role was played by line and by the principles of traditional Ukrainian ornaments, presenting flowers, plants and animals in two-dimensional forms."
Ivan Aivazovsky,Among the waves,1898,Among_the_waves,"“Among the Waves” is the canvas of the hand of master-marine painter Ivan Konstantinovich Aivazovsky, written by him in 1898, when his creator had already crossed the eighty-year mark. The canvas captures the viewer with its noisy waves. The viewer observes an all-consuming and boundless, azure, ultramarine, steel, turquoise, blue-green, emerald, dazzling white sea. The picture is literally saturated with moisture, freely bubbling and as if going beyond the boundaries of a small space of the canvas."
Ivan Aivazovsky,View of Tiflis,1869,view-of-tiflis,"This painting exemplifies the naturalism and realism for which the artist was so renowned. The detail in the foreground and the expanse of the view is almost as alluring as the clear blue sky. The painting illustrates the heart of a bustling city, complete with merchants on camelback, and ladies watching the crowd from their balconies, and sets it against the beautiful expanse of development throughout the valley below, from the hilltops and cliff faces, to the valley below. The tree leaves themselves look as if they might rustle in with a slight breeze. The play of light and shadow is also skillfully done, suggesting that the sun is growing low on the horizon."

The inner movement of the creative process is highlighted, historical figures from long ago times take on a new color. Few artists turn to the subject of the princely age, because it requires great knowledge and deeper studies of the historical events of the princely time.

Peter Andrusivws ""Baptism of Rus-Ukraine"" was recognized as the ""official"" painting of the Millennium of the Baptism of Rus by the Ukrainian diaspora in 1988."
Petro Andrusiw,,1968,,"his canvas shows a large group of people rendered in a stylized manner which gives the painting a rhythmic harmoby while eliminating unnecessary details. These paintings are close to ancient mural traditions and preserve many traits of Byzantine composition. Andrusiw has succesfully combined his art with tradition, creating a style which appeals to many."
